/**
 * Throws an error when the condition is falsy, optionally pass in a message to
 * describe the error.
 *
 * Best to use asserts where data is about to be stored. Then errors are caught
 * early, close to the cause. Otherwise data with broken expectation might hang
 * around, only to cause errors when used later on, with no pointer back to what
 * caused that bad state.
 *
 * Note that when an assert fails, consider that a fatal error caused by buggy
 * code. The program should halt, or perhaps do some kind of high level
 * recovery, and the bug should be reported and fixed. Asserts are not well
 * suited to use as defensive programming, but are good to use to quickly
 * highlight mistakes while writing new code.
 *
 * Also note asserts should not have side effects, the program should continue
 * to work when asserts are compiled away. Because asserts might be compiled
 * away in production code.
 *
 * And finally, both the condition should be cheap, and the message should not
 * do string interpolation, instead you can pass in multiple parts of the
 * message.

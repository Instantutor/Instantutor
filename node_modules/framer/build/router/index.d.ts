/**
 * @module
 * This module is meant to be used as the entrypoint to import everything `framer` needs from `@framerjs/router`.
 * We need it so we can easily swap private`@framerjs/router` with a stub for Handshake.
 *
 * NOTE: If you re-export some additional API in this file,
 *       please make sure you added a stub version of that API to `./stub.tsx`.

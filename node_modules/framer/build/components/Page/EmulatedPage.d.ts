 * The Page component allows you to create horizontally or vertically swipeable areas. It can be
 * imported from the Framer Library and used in code components. Add children to create pages to
 * swipe between. These children will be stretched to the size of the page component by default,
 * but can also be set to auto to maintain their original size.

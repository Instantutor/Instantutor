# Instantutor
Welcome to Instantutor!

Instantutor is a Peer-to-Peer system that allows students to connect with educators/tutors/people
with specific skills to maximize resource utilization across a campus.

The development of this project was motivated by the significant rise in demand of 
one-on-one tutoring during the Covid-19 pandemic.
